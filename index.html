        Abstract—School shootings in the USA claim many lives and
        it’s a growing concern for students and families. This paper will
        analyze these shootings and will look at some possible reasons
        behind why they are happening. We will look at incident types,
        incident numbers, guns used, mental health, gun laws, and gun
        proficiency of the shooters.

       <span class="bold"> INTRODUCTION</span> <br>
        In 1999, a high school massacre in Columbine,
        Colorado shook the US. With 15 deaths and 21 injured, this
        attack was one of the deadliest mass shootings in the US.
        Families of the victims were devastated by their losses, and the
        country prayed that this event would never happen again.
        However, the number of school shootings in the US increased
        rapidly after the devastating massacre. Post-Columbine, the US
        dealt with more than 380 school shootings all around the
        country, with 89 of them happening in the 2020s. Some claim
        that the reason for these events are notoriously lax gun laws
        around the country while others offer different explanations.
        However, decades after Columbine, there is still no clear
        attempt by the government to reduce or eliminate these
        incidents. <br> <br>
       <span class="bold"> I. PURPOSE OF THIS ESSAY </span><br>
        In this essay, we aim to analyze the US school
        shootings, their causes and whether they are increasing or not.
        We will look at the data about school shootings which consists
        of age, race, gun experience and lastly targets of the shooter. To
        analyze the underlying reasons for these events we will look at
        different explanations for why they keep happening. First, we
        will look at the gun laws of each state and compare states with
        strict and lax laws and whether these laws correlate with school
        shootings or not. We will also look at how mental health affects
        these shootings. <br> <br>
        <span class="bold">II. DETAILS ABOUT SHOOTINGS</span> <br>
        <span class="italic">A. General Details:</span>  <br>
        We will start by talking about the statistics related to these
        school shootings. First, we need to understand the term mass
        shooting. This term refers to incidents of gun violence where
        multiple people lost their lives. This term is used for various 
        violent crimes; including, but not limited to, shootings that
        happen in schools. Prior to the 1999 Columbine high school
        shooting, which left 24 people injured and 13 dead, there were
        usually six months between mass shootings [5]. In the period
        between Columbine and the 2015 Charleston church shooting,
        it dropped to one almost every 2.5 months [5]. After 2015, it
        dropped further, to one every six weeks [5]. Data even mentions
        that one-third of the total death toll since 1966 is after 2015 [5].
        The third-deadliest school shooting happened in May 2022 at
        Uvalde High School in Texas, which led to controversy about
        the lack of police response.

    <div class="graph">
        <img src="./Gun Incidents BAR.png" alt="">
        <img src="./School Incidents LINE.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div>As seen in Figure 1, in 2021 the number of school incidents
        peaked compared to other 5 decades, almost more than two
        times gun incidents happened compared to previous year and
        summation of 2021 and 2022 years are more than any other two
        years combined. Until 2010, the number of incidents were
        almost always below 50 and did not have a continuous upward
        trend. However, after hitting a historical low in 2010 it started a
        positive trend and increased every year. The increase in these numbers
        scares families and their children to go to school every
        day. According to a recent survey, more than half of young
        people say that they worry about mass shootings at least once a
        week, and almost a third of them claim to have directly
        experienced gun violence [7]. Further survey done by Pew
        Research Center, it is expressed that 57% of teens reported that
        they are concerned that their school is going to be the next school
        to be hit by shootings.
    </div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Before we start analyzing each incident, we must ask
        ourselves a question: What comes to our mind when we hear
        the words “School shooting”? The 1999 massacre at Columbine
        High School has shaped the stereotypical image of a school
        shooting: White, mentally disturbed teenagers killing their
        classmates en masse. The distribution of the types of mass
        shootings that happened within school grounds, however, tell a
        different story.
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./circIncidents.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>The pro-gun movement in the US has maintained that
        “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy
        with a gun.”. Looking at the graph, we can see that “good guy
        with a gun” incidents - Self-defense and Police-Involved
        Shootings - are exceedingly rare. As we can clearly see, the
        most common type of shooting incident in schools is escalation
        of dispute - regular arguments that turn fatal. The shooting
        incidents that we would commonly recognize as “school
        shootings” are categorized under the “Columbine-like” section.
        A further breakdown of this category can be found below.
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./col-like.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>A majority of “Columbine-like” attacks are caused by
        anger, suicidal thoughts and psychosis and therefore tied to the
        mental problems of the attacker. Attacks where the shooter was
        motivated by a racist ideology are the least common. The most
        common type of “Columbine-like” attacks is Indiscriminate
        shooting - attackers trying to kill as many people as possible in
        pursuit of a “high score”. <br> <br>
        More than half of all school shootings are homicides,
        attempted or nonfatal assault with 53% [4]. Since 2013, 302
        incidents of homicides have happened in school grounds [4].
        These incidents left 96 people dead and 265 injured. At least
        133 of them were students [4]. There are only 4 mass shootings
        that occurred between 2013 and 2021. While mass shootings
        are quite rare, they account for 19% of all gun deaths and 10%
        of all people that got shot in school grounds between 2013 and
        2021 [4]
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./Gun Incidents in K-12 Schools per State.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>Research also shows the number of gun incidents in each state
        in comparison to average school incidents. California has by far
        the most incidents that have happened in any state, with 215
        incidents since 1970. The runner-up is Texas with 38 more
        incidents. 18 of the total 51 states have more than average
        number of incidents - 41 per state. Also, states that banned
        “assault weapons” (a legal term that is not used in the firearms
        industry) like New York, California and Virginia still have
        above average number of gun incidents [1]. <br> <br>
       <span class="italic"> B. Age and Race of Shooters</span> <br>
        Research about the age and race of the school shooters
        reveals that 69% of students who used guns in schools are
        between 10 to 19 years old and 15% are between 20 to 29 [6].
        Most school shooters are Caucasian (76%), 12% are African
        Americans, 2% are Asians and 2% are Native Americans [6].
        While the shooters are most likely to be Caucasians, further
        study shows that only 26% of Black and 30% of Latino students feel
        safe in school, while Caucasians are more likely to feel more
        safe (39%) [7].
    </div>
    <div>
       <span class="italic">C. Gun Experience of Shooters</span>  <br>
        Many shooters had access to weapons and were
        experienced in using those weapons [3]. Figure 6 shows the
        firearms experience of the deadliest school shooters in the US.
        Figure 5. Gun incidents in schools per
        state 1970-2022.Research tells that 3 of the shooters had zero experience and it
        was the first time they ever used a gun. 7 of these shooters had
        some experience with guns. For example, it is reported that
        these shooters had some practice, grew up around guns or
        owned guns for a while before the shootings. 5 of these shooters
        are more experienced with guns. they had some kind of permit
        or license; they might have taken classes for gun usage or had
        more intensive practice before the shootings. Last 8 of these
        shooters are very experienced with guns before the shootings.
        These shooters had military, hunting or sharpshooter
        background, so they had years of consistent practice before the
        committed mass shootings. So as seen, 86.9% of the mass
        school shooters had experience with guns before the initial
        shootings.
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./Experience.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>
       <span class="italic"> D. Targets of Shooters</span> <br>
        Data shows that shooters harmed at least one of the
        faculty or staff members in 54% of the shootings [3]. In 41% of
        these shootings, victims included students. Attackers targeted
        multiple people in 46% of the shootings before it took place. In
        46% of the shootings, attackers harmed their chosen targets [3]. <br> <br>
       <span class="bold">III. EFFECTS OF GUN LAWS ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS </span> <br>
        The right to keep and bear firearms are enshrined in the US
        Constitution. Currently, there are over 390 million legally
        registered firearms in the US. In other words, the average
        American citizen owns 1.2 guns [8]. Ever since the first widely
        publicized massacre in Columbine high school, where two
        seventeen-year-old students managed to arm themselves with no
        less than four different guns in preparation for the attack, the
        high rate of firearm ownership and the ease of purchasing
        firearms in the US have been regularly criticized. Some political
        groups have argued that the rights mentioned in the Constitution
        do not apply to modern firearms which afford much greater
        firepower to the user than the firearms prevalent in the time of
        the Constitution’s writing and these modern firearms should be
        confiscated from their users. Political factions opposing this
        viewpoint have talked about the possibility of a second civil war,
        or <i> Boogaloo</i>, being triggered in the case of a nationwide police
        confiscation of civilian-owned firearms. We want to steer clear
        of this heated political debate and just look at the available data
        for what it is.
        Looking at the gun control and gun rights groups spendings, it
        can be seen that gun rights spendings is almost always more than
        gun control spendings [1]. In 2012, gun rights groups spent 20
        million dollars while gun control groups spent not more than 2
        million dollars [1]. This trend continued until 2016, where gun
        rights groups spent more than an overwhelming amount of
        nearly 55 million dollars [1]. While gun rights spendings
        outnumbered gun control spendings. Surprisingly, gun control
        spendings surpassed gun right spendings for the first time in
        2018 [1].
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./Restrictive Laws.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>Figure 7 shows how states with a number of restrictive gun laws
        affect gun incidents in schools. As seen in the figure, while
        California has the maximum amount of restrictive gun laws
        compared to other states in the USA, it also has the most amount
        of shootings in comparison. Trend line indicates there is not
        much of a difference between states with more restrictive laws
        and states with less restrictive laws. There might be several
        different factors why this is happening. First, shooters might
        have used guns obtained illegally. Shooters might have used
        guns that their family purchased or they might have bought it
        from more permissive states. Or perhaps the number of gun laws
        in place does not correlate with the number of gun control
        measures in place. <br> <br>
        We believe that this discrepancy should be researched with a
        more detailed study.
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./Survey.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>Figure 8 shows the results of the survey done about
        gun laws. When asked whether gun laws should be stricter or
        not in a 2022 study, only 57% of Americans wanted stricter gun
        laws. 32% wanted to keep it as it is and 10% wanted looser
        laws[1]. Figure 3 also shows that while there was an upward
        trend toward stricter gun laws after 2015, this trend dropped
        after 2020 [1]. In June of 2021 votes about stricter gun laws
        almost peaked and votes about keeping as is almost dropped to
        the lowest of the last 20 years. However, as seen in the last
        survey in October, votes for more strict laws dropped down
        again. With only half of the country demanding stricter laws, it
        might be hard to avoid or reduce gun related incidents in
        schools. <br> <br>
       <span class="bold"> IV. TYPES OF WEAPONS USED IN SCHOOL SHOOTINGS</span> <br>
        The National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934, was the
        first federal-level gun control law in the US. It made machine
        guns (firearms that can fire multiple times with a single pull of
        the trigger) out-of-reach for most American citizens. However,
        civilians in the US can still buy self-loading and repeating
        firearms with ease. Self-loading guns fire once per trigger pull,
        and can be fired shot after shot by simply pulling the trigger
        repeatedly. Repeating guns also fire once per trigger pull but
        require manipulation by the shooter’s hand before firing again.
        A handgun, under US law, is any gun that cannot be rested
        against the shooter’s shoulder for support during firing. The
        overwhelming majority of handguns are self-loading pistols
        designed to be easily concealed on the user’s body and fired
        from one hand. Rifles are guns that can be rested against the
        user’s shoulder during firing and have spiral grooves (“rifling”)
        cut into the barrel for stabilizing the bullet. Most rifles are
        repeating firearms, but some WW2-era self-loading rifles are
        also included in the rifles section in our dataset. Shotguns are
        similar in form to rifles, but do not possess spiral-cut barrels.
        They are largely used for hunting and can be either self-loading
        or repeating firearms. SLRs, or Self-Loading Rifles, are the
        “made-for-civilian-use” versions of modern military rifles.
        They are distinguished from rifles by their modern design, selfloading function and detachable ammunition box which enables
        quick reloading. PCCs, or Pistol-Caliber Carbines, are selfloading firearms that use the same ammunition types as pistols
        while retaining the ability to be rested against the shoulder.
        PCCs are some of the most heavily regulated types of firearms
        in the US - both the overall length and the barrel length of a
        PCC is subject to federal laws. <br> <br>
        Figure 9 shows the distribution of firearms used in US mass
        shootings between 1966 and 2022 by category.
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./allguns.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>We can see from Figure 9 that handguns were used in
        more shootings than all the other types of firearms combined.
        SLRs are the second most common type, but the number of
        SLR attacks are less than half of the number of handgun
        attacks. Number of rifle and shotgun attacks are almost the
        same, whereas PCC attacks are the rarest. We believe that this
        is due to the fact that PCCs are the most heavily regulated type
        of firearm. This trend continues in the chart below, which
        shows the types of firearms used in mass shootings that
        happened on school grounds within the same timeframe.
    </div>
    <div class="graph"><img src="./schguns.png" alt=""></div>
    <div>Handguns are the most common type of firearm used
        in shooting incidents that occurred on school grounds. PCCs
        are still the least common, possibly due to the reason we
        mentioned previously. Interestingly, rifle attacks are more
        common than SLR attacks in schools. We don’t have an
        explanation for why this is the case. Perhaps a more detailed
        study can solve this mystery. Lastly, we found no evidence on
        the usage of machine guns in school shootings. <br> <br>
       <span class="bold"> V. EFFECT OF MENTAL HEALTH ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS</span> <br>
        Another oft-discussed issue related to school
        shootings is the mental health of students. Obviously, students’
        mental health may be affected by numerous disparate factors
        such as students’ relationship with their friends, family and
        teachers, income level of students’ families and even
        underlying genetic factors. The similarity of different attacks
        carried out by different shooters suggest a similar mindset
        prevalent among the shooters. We aim to search for correlations
        between the mental health of students in the US and school
        shooters. <br> <br>
        According to research, just 34% of attackers have ever had their
        mental health checked, and only 17% have been given a mental
        disorder diagnosis [6]. It is also important that 78% of all school
        shooters had suicide attempts or suicidal ideations before the
        attack and among 61% of shooters that has history with suicidal
        thoughts, also had symptoms of desperation and extreme
        depression [6]. Further analysis also reveals that 71% of the
        shooters experienced bullying and 87% of bullied shooters left
        evidence that they experienced severe bullying [6]. Lastly, 10%
        of the shooters that got diagnosed with mental illness failed to
        follow their prescribed medications. From what we see from
        this data it can be said that a large number of school shooters
        had some mental health problems before the shootings took
        place and most of them also dealt with bullying. Therefore, it
        can be said that mental health problems played a big role in
        these shootings. At this point we should note that none of these
        mental health issues excuse the horrible acts of the shooters.

    <div> <span class="bold"> VI. CONCLUSION </span><br>
        As mentioned in the beginning, the number of gun
        related incidents in schools are rising uncontrollably. It's
        become a serious issue that even small children worry about
        their well being before going to their schools. The USA should
        take more strict actions to avoid further innocent casualties.
        As for the reasons behind these mass school shootings,
        mental health issues play an important role. Almost 80% of all
        mass shooters had suicidal thoughts and 71% of them got
        bullied. These might have caused homicidal thoughts within the
        shooters that eventually led to death of innocents. <br> <br>
        The description of the most common shooting incident
        in US schools is, contrary to popular belief, not “Mentally
        disturbed teenager brought an AR-15 to school.”. It is “Middle-aged dad got into an argument in the parking lot and pulled out
        his Glock.”. There are over 21 million people with concealed
        carry permits in the US [13]. There is also a strong culture of
        “EDC” - Every Day Carry, which means a large number of
        Americans carry a pistol with them at all times. Subsequently,
        the most common type of weapon used in school shootings is
        the handgun, and the majority of shooting incidents in schools
        happen as an escalation of violence. <br> <br>
        The gun rights movement in the US likes to talk about
        the citizens’ right to self-defense and how armed villains can
        only be stopped by armed heroes, but our data shows that gun
        violence could be greatly reduced through applying stricter
        regulations on handguns and convincing Americans to leave
        their handguns at home. The opposite side of this argument, the
        gun control movement in the US, is also at fault. They insist on
        enacting an outright ban on SLRs. Our data shows that such a
        ban, if put into effect, would be inconsequential in reducing gun
        violence in the US. The largest problem is the handguns and
        their ubiquity in the US, not SLRs. Not all gun control
        measures, however, are without merit. The effects of the 1934
        National Firearms Act is still being felt. Our data shows that
        machine guns and compact weapons such as the PCCs, both
        heavily restricted under the NFA, are the least common types
        of weapons used in mass shootings.
